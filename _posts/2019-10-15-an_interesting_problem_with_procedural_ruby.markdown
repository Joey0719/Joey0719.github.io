Doing coding challenges is an excellent way to improve your Ruby and problem-solving skills. Why? Because you put  all 

focus on solving one specific problem. You don't have to worry about anything else. They stretch your thinking skills,allow 

you to explore interesting language features and most of them can be finished in under one hour. Some of these 

challenges require specialized knowledge about some algorithm or way to do things. In my experience Procedural Ruby 

came fairly easy to me and though out my journey with these challenges I adapted quickly. Is it fair to say I didn't run into 

no issues not quite but as long as you understand your error the answer comes fast. For me, it's all about elegance and 

readability. I've tried many languages in my life but got stuck with Ruby because it's just highly readable if you code with it

properly. Ruby is used in a lot of projects. It's used in server maintenance and tooling as well as developing web 

backends. It is a fully capable language, and despite some of the anti-hype you might hear, it's got more in common

with Python than most people are willing to believe. Both languages are interpreted, both suffer the ill effects of the

GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) and more. Be aware Ruby is what powers a lot of things on the internet, like Github, Gitlab,

Airbnb, Salsify and many more.
