  It was 2016 and I was working multiple jobs. During that time, I was employed as a general laborer for a construction company and a cashier for Little Caesars. At the end of each day I would sit on my bed and always wondered what if I followed my dreams and take steps to gain success in the computer field. It took me 3 years to decide to give it a shot. The first step was to quit both jobs and find one that pays enough for me to survive after a couple of weeks searching, I became a landscaper. It wasn't the ideal job, but it helps me focus on my education. The final step was to find a school and I'm glad I did my research before jumping into something that wasn't for me. Then came Flatiron the software guru flatiron caught my interest immediately as soon as I started the bootcamp I was hooked. The instructors are very helpful, and the curriculum was super challenging. The bootcamps was the best idea yet not only does it pull you in it allows you to experience the flatiron way.
			
   I believe it takes true will and a lot of motivation to take up a course such as software development. I also realized that the intellectual level I would always be challenged and have something to learn when it comes to software development. The work at your own pace is what sold me the most. I can code part-time and still be able to work a full-time job. It would take me 10 months to complete the course and that’s a blessing because with more time I learn a lot better so I’m glad to make the jump with flatiron and my many reasons of learning software development will pay off and I will become a software engineering guru.
	 
So eventually I decided on software development for a few reasons:

1.	I was sick and tired of working multiple jobs.
2.	The schedule was perfect. 
3.	The fact I can work remotely.
