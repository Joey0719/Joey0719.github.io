Many people will say yes, it is hard to learn code. And it’s a sad fact that a lot of these people give up and fail. But what these people don’t realize is that there’s no such thing as an ‘instant coder’. It takes a lot of time and practice to get good at coding. If you assumed you’d be able to write programs for IBM after only a week – or even a month – no wonder you’re finding it hard.

Now if you’re looking for the magic bullet that will turn you into an instant coder – you won’t find it here. But what you will find is an explanation on why many people find coding difficult – and how to make it easier.

Why Coding is So Hard
A lot of people get excited by the ‘learn code’ craze. They expect that they can become a code pro just by completing a tutorial or two. So they find some code tutorials online, complete them, but then realize that they’re not getting anywhere. They’re not a code pro, and they still don’t have a clue how to produce a website or app.

This is when they’ll give up and say…


“It’s too hard for me!”

“I’m not smart enough!”

“I’m just not cut out for coding!”

But that’s not necessarily true. Coding isn’t hard, it just requires more time and practice than you might expect. To be a competent coder, you need to learn how to produce products, not just write code. To be a web developer, you need to be able to make a website, not just write out HTML tags. To be a mobile developer, you need to be able to create an app, not just construct objects in Objective-C or Java.

See the pattern?

Most coding training doesn’t cover these things, so it’s no wonder people get frustrated and give up. The reason you might think it’s ‘hard’ is because you’re not getting results. But you must understand that in order to develop your coding skills, you can’t just mindlessly follow instructions from a tutorial. You must take charge and start making.
